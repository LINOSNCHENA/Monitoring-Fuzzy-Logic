# 1. MODEL PREDICTION CONTROLLERS-(MPC)

These scripts solve a control problem by prediction the future parameter of a dynamic system.  The following are the three different types of models are used; 
1. MATRIX computations model
2. CARIMA computations model
3. Diophantine equations model

## The problem and task at hand

Given that various obstacle would have different effects, we have experimented on two types.  Formal and Uniform disturbance. The effects simulated in MATLAB and performance of controller is observed. Comparisons for the computation based on the disturbance that is inflicted;
1. A-E are using Matrix computational method
2. F-J are using CARIMA computational method
3. K-O are using Diaphonies computational method

## Plots of results and observations

Various results were obtained. The following are the comparison criteria;
1. Without any disturbance
2. Uniform disturbance
3. Gaussian disturbance

# 2. FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER-(FLC)

1. Car cruise controller.
2. Force1 + force2 + force3.
3. Increase A1 to A2 by mass 1000kg to 2000kg.
4. MRAC vs PID.

## Plots of results and observations

Various results were obtained. The following are the comparison criteria;

1. Plots differ on effect of disturbance.
2. Plot A-B-C-D-E-F.
3. Parameters are speed, comfort and vehicle safety.
